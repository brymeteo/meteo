1
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:16,408
Pull yourself together, Teddy.
Pull yourself together.

2
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,500
It's just water.

3
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,669
It's a lot of water.

4
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,713
A lot of...

5
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,635
Come on.

6
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,829
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

7
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,707
I just can't... Can't stomach the water.

8
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,880
- You're my new partner.
- That's right.

9
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,968
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

10
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,096
Doesn't exactly square with
"Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,"

11
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,640
- I'll give you that.
- The legend?

12
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,393
What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

13
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,855
Seattle. I came from
the office in Seattle.

14
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,734
How long you been with the Marshals?

15
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,236
Four years.

16
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,157
So you know how small it is.

17
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,658
Sure.

18
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,662
What about you?
You got a girl? Married?

19
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,747
I was.

20
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,219
She died.

21
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,182
- Jesus. I don't...
- Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,811
There was a fire at the apartment
building while I was at work.

23
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,605
Four people died.

24
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,525
It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire. See, that's important.

25
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,319
I'm sorry, boss.

26
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,197
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

27
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,365
Oh, here, have one of mine.

28
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,952
I could've sworn they were
in my jacket before I got on.

29
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,747
Government employees
will rob you blind.

30
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,417
Thanks.

31
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,213
They give you a briefing about
the institution before you left?

32
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,965
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

33
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,927
For the criminally insane.

34
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,096
Well, if it's just folks running
around hearing voices

35
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,642
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

36
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,654
- Is that where we're headed?
- Yep.

37
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,531
The other side of the island
is rock bluffs

38
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,159
all the way down
to the edge of the water.

39
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,704
The dock, it's the only way on or off.

40
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,750
We'll be casting off
as soon as you two are ashore.

41
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,461
I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry up about it.

42
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,297
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

43
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,326
Never seen a Marshals badge before.

44
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,871
I'm Deputy Warden McPherson,
gentlemen.

45
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,123
Welcome to Shutter Island.

46
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,251
I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,433
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

48
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,893
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

49
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,190
Electrified perimeter.

50
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,777
How can you tell?

51
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,696
I've seen something like it before.

52
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,145
All right. You gentlemen will
be accorded all the help we can give,

53
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,190
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

54
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,650
Is that understood?

55
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,110
Absolutely.

56
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,905
The red brick building on your right
is Ward A, the male ward.

57
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,367
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

58
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,412
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.

59
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,080
An old Civil War fort.

60
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,582
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

61
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,584
Admittance to Ward C is forbidden

62
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,337
without the written consent
and physical presence

63
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,965
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

64
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,842
Is that understood?

65
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,220
You act like insanity is catching.

66
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,351
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

67
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,231
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

68
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,817
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

69
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,903
Executive order 319
of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries

70
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,030
states that when inside a penitentiary,

71
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,534
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

72
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:39,416
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

73
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,147
Okay. Now that the official stuff's done,
come on, boys,

74
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,191
what do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

75
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,914
When did she escape? This prisoner?

76
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,168
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have
to fill you in on the situation. Protocol.

77
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,378
Correctional officers
at a mental institution,

78
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,631
that's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying.

79
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:31,134
It's the only facility of its kind in the U.S.,
even the world.

80
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,762
We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

81
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,805
ones no other hospital can manage.

82
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,807
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

83
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,809
He's created something
really unique here.

84
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,480
It's a hospital for people our society
normally considers beyond treatment.

85
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,048
Top of his class at Johns Hopkins,
then Harvard...

86
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,218
IDs, gentlemen.

87
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,848
Show your badges, gentlemen.

88
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,894
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times by Scotland Yard,

89
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,729
Ml5, the OSS...

90
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,398
Why?

91
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,149
What do you mean?

92
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,737
What do intelligence agencies
want to consult a psychiatrist about?

93
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,115
I guess you'll have to ask him.

94
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,002
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

95
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,045
Marshal Aule.

96
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,215
Thank you, Deputy Warden.
That will be all.

97
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,968
Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

98
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,305
He had a lot to say about you.

99
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,600
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

100
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,977
And what would that be, exactly?

101
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,731
A moral fusion between law and order
and clinical care.

102
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,817
Pardon me, Doc.
A what between what and what?

103
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,827
Those paintings are quite accurate.

104
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,787
Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here

105
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,082
were shackled and left in their own filth.

106
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,459
They were beaten,

107
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,794
as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

108
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,963
We drove screws into their brains,

109
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,884
we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness

110
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,428
or even drowned.

111
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,472
- And now?
- We treat them.

112
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,766
Try to heal, try to cure.

113
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,476
And if that fails,
at least we provide them

114
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,812
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

115
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,149
These are all violent offenders, right?

116
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,485
I mean, they've hurt people.

117
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,989
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases, yes.

118
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,908
Then, personally, Doctor,
I'd have to say,

119
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,369
screw their sense of calm.

120
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,164
It's my job to treat my patients,
not their victims.

121
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,707
I'm not here to judge.

122
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,418
- So this female prisoner...
- Patient.

123
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,171
Excuse me. Patient,

124
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:18,343
one Rachel Solando,
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

125
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,679
Last night between 10:00 and midnight.

126
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,347
Is she considered dangerous?

127
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,059
You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.

128
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,854
She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

129
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,233
She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

130
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,194
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

131
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,614
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

132
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:45,453
- And what about the husband?
- He died on the beaches of Normandy.

133
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,541
She's a war widow. She starved herself
when she first came here.

134
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,460
She insisted the children weren't dead.

135
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,056
Sorry, Doctor. You don't happen
to have an aspirin, do you?

136
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,808
Prone to headaches, Marshal?

137
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,145
Sometimes. But today,
I'm a little more prone to seasickness.

138
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,105
Dehydration.

139
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,815
- You all right, boss?
- Yeah.

140
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,609
In that case, you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

141
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,236
Thanks so much.

142
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,115
Rachel still believes
the children are alive.

143
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,453
She also believes this place is her home
in the Berkshires.

144
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,705
You're kidding me.

145
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,039
She's never once in two years

146
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,791
acknowledged that
she's in an institution.

147
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,754
She believes we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

148
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,047
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

149
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,133
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

150
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,595
and she gives us all parts
to play in that fiction.

151
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,598
So have you searched the grounds yet?

152
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,267
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

153
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,852
Not a trace.

154
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,982
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

155
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,861
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

156
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,159
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

157
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,877
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

158
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,963
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

159
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,974
Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

160
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,977
I mean,
she's in a mental institution, right?

161
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,063
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

162
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,315
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

163
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,775
Two pairs.

164
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:43,112
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

165
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,616
So, she left here barefoot?

166
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,495
Come on, Doc, she couldn't get
10 yards in that terrain.

167
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,164
Marshal?

168
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,185
This is definitely Rachel's handwriting.

169
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,105
I have no idea
what the law of four is, though.

170
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,024
- It's not a psychiatric term?
- I'm afraid not.

171
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,609
"Who is 67?"

172
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,945
Fuck if I know.

173
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,866
I have to say that's quite close
to my clinical conclusion.

174
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,868
Think it's just random scribblings?

175
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,705
Oh, no, not at all. Rachel's smart.
Brilliant, in fact.

176
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,206
This paper could be important.

177
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,167
Excuse me, Doctor,
but we're gonna have to hold on to this.

178
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,627
Of course.

179
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,424
And you say
she had to come through here?

180
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:48,761
After lights out,
the orderlies play cards in here.

181
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,181
Last night, there were seven men
sitting at the base of those stairs

182
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,725
playing stud poker.

183
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,853
Yet somehow,
Rachel managed to slip past them.

184
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,563
Why?

185
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,274
How? She turns invisible?

186
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,235
Doctor, we're gonna need access
to the personnel files

187
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,361
of all the medical staff.

188
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,239
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies,
anyone who was working then.

189
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,117
We'll take your request
under consideration.

190
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,828
This is not a request, Doctor.

191
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,414
This is a federal facility,
and a dangerous prisoner...

192
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,708
- Patient.
- Patient...

193
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,085
has escaped. Now, you will comply or...

194
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,504
All I can say is I'll see what I can do.

195
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,424
Doctor, we're gonna need
to speak with the staff.

196
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,551
Do you understand?

197
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,845
I'll assemble them in the common room
after dinner.

198
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,222
If you have any further questions,

199
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,601
feel free to join the deputy warden
in the search.

200
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,367
It's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water's freezing.

201
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,495
Current was strong last night,
tide pushing in.

202
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,163
She'd have drowned
or been crushed on the rocks,

203
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,416
and her body would have
washed back up on shore.

204
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,631
What about those caves down there?
Have you checked them?

205
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,092
No way she could get there.

206
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,970
The bases of those cliffs
are covered in poison ivy,

207
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:16,099
live oak, sumac, a thousand plants
with thorns as big as my dick.

208
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,061
You said yourself, Marshal,
she's got no shoes.

209
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,069
All right, let's check the other side.

210
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,411
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

211
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,872
The guards already searched inside it.

212
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,002
What's in there? More patients?

213
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,212
Sewage treatment facility.

214
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,591
It's getting dark soon.
I'm calling this off for tonight.

215
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,218
Let's go, boys!

216
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,016
You were on watch on the landing, huh?

217
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,519
Yeah. Couldn't nobody get in or out
of their room on that corridor

218
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,354
without me seeing.

219
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:08,151
Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does
she have to pass to get down here?

220
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,035
Me. Glen Miga.

221
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,871
Sir, I didn't see nothing.

222
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,290
And you were at your post all night?

223
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,709
Yeah, but I didn't see a thing.

224
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,920
Glen.

225
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,757
Glen.

226
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,344
Tell me the truth.

227
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,764
I...

228
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,060
I maybe went to the bathroom.

229
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,229
What? You breached protocol. Christ...

230
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,648
I wasn't gone more than a minute.

231
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,735
All right, look. Let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

232
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,238
Miss Solando was put in her room
for lights out.

233
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,742
Does anyone here know
what she did before that?

234
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,035
Anyone?

235
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,955
Come on, anyone,
anyone, anyone, anyone.

236
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,541
She was in a group therapy session.

237
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,920
Anything unusual occur?

238
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,214
Define "unusual".

239
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,757
Excuse me?

240
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:17,220
This is a mental institution, Marshal,
for the criminally insane.

241
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,847
Usual isn't a big part of our day.

242
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,934
I will rephrase.

243
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,938
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more,

244
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,524
let's say, I don't know,
memorable than...

245
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,359
- Normal?
- Exactly.

246
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,820
No. Sorry.

247
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,490
Did Miss Solando say anything
during group therapy?

248
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,660
She was worried about the rain.

249
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:45,206
And she hated the food here.
Complained constantly,

250
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,041
last night included.

251
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,546
So you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

252
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,966
Yes, Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

253
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,426
Dr. Sheehan?

254
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,471
Yes, he was running the session.

255
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,310
He's Rachel's primary, the psychiatrist
who directly oversees her care.

256
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,815
We're gonna need
to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

257
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:15,403
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
He left on the ferry this morning.

258
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,823
His vacation was already planned.
He'd been putting it off too long.

259
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:23,661
You're in a state of lockdown,
a dangerous patient has escaped,

260
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,915
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

261
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,169
Well, of course. He's a doctor.

262
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,342
Do you have the phone number
for where he's gone?

263
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,720
Hello? Hello?

264
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,223
Hello?

265
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,601
Anybody there?

266
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,312
I'm sorry, sir, but it's all down.
All the lines.

267
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,272
The storm's hitting the mainland
like a hammer.

268
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,316
If you get it working,
come find me immediately.

269
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,860
The marshals need to make
an important call.

270
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,278
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,326
Hello? Hello?

272
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,494
I'm afraid I have evening rounds
in the wards,

273
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,332
but I'll be having drinks and a cigar
at my house around 9:00,

274
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,417
if you'd care to drop by.

275
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,794
Good. We can talk then, right?

276
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,257
We have been talking, Marshal.

277
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,027
Gotta say, I'm thinking
I got in the wrong line of public service.

278
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,572
It is a little overwhelming.
It was constructed during the Civil War,

279
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,909
the same time as the military fort
housing Ward C.

280
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,252
This is the original
commander's quarters.

281
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,922
When Uncle Sam got the bill,
the commander was court-martialed.

282
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,049
I can see why.

283
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,677
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

284
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,637
No.

285
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,190
- It's Mahler.
- Quite right, Marshal.

286
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,903
Forgive me, gentlemen.
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

287
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,498
Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor.

288
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,628
Your poison, gentlemen?

289
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,715
- Rye, if you got it.
- Soda and ice, please. Thanks.

290
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,386
You don't indulge in alcohol?
I'm surprised.

291
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,391
Isn't it common for men
in your profession to imbibe?

292
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,728
Common enough. And yours?

293
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,522
I'm sorry?

294
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,483
- Your profession, Doctor. Psychiatry.
- Yes.

295
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,029
I always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

296
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,906
Not that I've noticed.

297
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,118
What's that?
Iced tea in your glass, there?

298
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,829
Excellent, Marshal.

299
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,082
You have outstanding
defense mechanisms.

300
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:19,503
You must be quite adept
at interrogations, hmm?

301
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,973
Men like you are my specialty,
you know?

302
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,351
Men of violence.

303
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,311
Now that's a hell of an assumption
to make.

304
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,021
No assumption. No, not at all.

305
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:41,150
You misunderstand me.
I said you are men of violence.

306
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,362
I'm not accusing you
of being violent men.

307
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,446
That's quite different.

308
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,366
No, please. Please. Edify us, Doctor.

309
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,037
You both served overseas, huh?

310
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,372
It's not much of a stretch, Doc.

311
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,958
For all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there.

312
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,502
No, you were not.

313
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,602
Since the schoolyard,

314
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:20,731
neither of you has ever walked away
from a physical conflict.

315
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,983
No, no, not because you enjoy it,

316
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,946
but because retreat isn't something
you consider an option.

317
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,948
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

318
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,159
Yes. "Raised".

319
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,497
And who raised you, Marshal?

320
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,165
Me?

321
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,668
Wolves.

322
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,507
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

323
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,693
Do you believe in God, Marshal?

324
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,826
No, I'm quite serious.

325
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,418
You ever seen a death camp, Doctor?

326
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,810
His English really is very good.

327
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,730
You hit the consonants
a tad hard, though.

328
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,483
You're a German?

329
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,694
Is legal immigration a crime, Marshal?

330
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,197
I don't know, Doctor. You tell us.

331
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,700
Now, listen.

332
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,702
We're gonna need those files
on Sheehan

333
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,579
and the rest of the staff as well.

334
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,791
No personnel files will
be released to you. Period.

335
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,961
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

336
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,546
Bullshit, out of the question!

337
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,713
Bullshit!

338
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,591
Just who the hell's in charge here,
anyway, huh?

339
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:56,220
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison
to our Board of Overseers.

340
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,472
He relayed your request,
and it's been refused.

341
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,892
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse, and neither do you, sir.

342
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,688
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we'll do all we can to help.

343
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,356
This investigation is over.

344
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,733
We're gonna file our reports
and we're gonna hand it over to...

345
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,319
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys. That's right.

346
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,156
We'll be taking the ferry back
in the morning. Come on, Chuck.

347
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,166
Nice night.

348
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,175
You'll be bunking
in the orderlies' quarters.

349
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,314
Hey, boss.

350
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,025
We really packing it in?

351
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,818
Why?

352
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:57,656
I guess... I don't know,
I just never really quit anything before.

353
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,909
We haven't heard the truth
once yet, Chuck.

354
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,247
Listen, Rachel Solando didn't slip out
of a locked cell, barefoot,

355
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,540
without any help.

356
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,252
I think she had a lot of help.

357
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,921
Maybe Cawley's sitting up
in his mansion right now

358
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,299
rethinking his whole attitude.

359
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,845
- Maybe, in the morning, we'll be...
- You're bluffing?

360
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,097
I didn't say that.

361
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,160
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

362
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,288
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

363
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,084
I killed a lot of people in the war.

364
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,712
Is that why you drink?

365
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,050
Are you real?

366
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,260
No.

367
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,933
She's still here.

368
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,935
Who?

369
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,270
Rachel?

370
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,148
She never left.

371
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,666
Remember when we stayed
in the cabin in the summer, Teddy?

372
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,168
We were so happy.

373
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,005
She's here.

374
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,049
You can't leave.

375
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,731
I'm not gonna leave.

376
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,984
I love you so much.

377
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,907
I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.

378
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,033
No.

379
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,995
I am.

380
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,791
You have to wake up.

381
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,170
I won't go.

382
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,756
You're here.

383
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:24,553
I'm not. You have to face that.

384
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,224
But she is.

385
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,853
So is he.

386
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,148
Who?

387
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,985
Laeddis.

388
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,617
- I have to go.
- No.

389
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,371
No, please. Please.
I need to hold on to you.

390
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,708
- Just a little bit longer, please.
- Oh, God, Teddy.

391
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,794
You have to let me go.

392
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,588
I can't.

393
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,705
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

394
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,920
Doctor!

395
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,130
Doctor, Doctor.

396
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,217
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

397
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,219
I thought your investigation was finished.

398
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,264
Well, it's not like
we could take the ferry.

399
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,393
Now, was Rachel receiving
any other treatments for her illnesses?

400
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,522
Do you know the state of the mental
health field these days, gentlemen?

401
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,774
No, not a clue, Doctor.

402
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,192
War.

403
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,028
The old school believes
in surgical intervention.

404
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,613
Psychosurgery.

405
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,658
Procedures like
the transorbital lobotomy.

406
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,079
Some say the patients
become reasonable, docile.

407
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,456
Others say they become zombies.

408
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,709
- And the new school?
- Psychopharmacology.

409
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,044
A new drug has just been approved
called Thorazine,

410
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,298
which relaxes psychotic patients,
you could say tames them.

411
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,716
And which school are you, Doctor?

412
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,345
Me? I have this radical idea that
if you treat a patient with respect,

413
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,558
listen to him, try and understand,
you just might reach him.

414
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,480
Come on, Marge. It's okay.

415
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,442
- These patients, huh?
- Even these.

416
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,944
What should be a last resort
is becoming a first response.

417
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,907
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
it all goes away.

418
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,242
Rachel Solando was on
a combination of drugs

419
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,244
meant to keep her
from becoming violent,

420
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,414
but it was only intermittently effective.

421
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,124
The greatest obstacle to her recovery

422
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,169
was her refusal
to face what she had done.

423
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,171
"Was"

424
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:09,593
Is there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense, Doctor?

425
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,724
Look outside, Marshal.
Why do you think?

426
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,274
Next up is Peter Breene.

427
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,693
Assaulted his father's nurse
with broken glass.

428
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,322
Nurse survived,
but her face is permanently disfigured.

429
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,865
I can't wait.

430
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:38,121
She'd smile at me. She was so sweet,
but you could see it in her eyes.

431
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,583
She liked to be naked, to suck cock.

432
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,711
Okay, Mr. Breene.

433
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,757
And then she asked me
if she can have a glass of water?

434
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:52,010
Alone, in the kitchen,
like that's no big deal?

435
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,056
- Well, why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.

436
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,352
She wanted me to pull out my thing
so that she could laugh at it.

437
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,897
Mr. Breene.

438
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,068
We need to ask you
some questions, okay?

439
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,489
When I cut her, she screamed.

440
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,119
But she scared me.

441
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,415
- What did she expect?
- Interesting.

442
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,044
But we're here
to talk about Rachel Solando, okay?

443
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,171
Rachel Solando. Do you...

444
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,507
Do you know that
she drowned her own kids?

445
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,718
She drowned her kids!

446
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,846
This is... This is a sick fucking world
we live in, I'll tell you that.

447
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,681
But you know what?
They should be gassed.

448
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:42,019
All of them.
The retards, the killers, the niggers.

449
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,771
You kill your own kid, gas the bitch.

450
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,943
Could you stop that?

451
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,864
- That nurse...
- Please, stop that.

452
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:57,034
That nurse, maybe she had kids, huh?

453
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,370
A husband.

454
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,832
Just trying to make ends meet,

455
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,502
lead a normal life.

456
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,756
It says in your file that

457
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,301
you tore her face off. Didn't you?

458
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,762
Congratulations.

459
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,765
No more normal for her,
not ever again. No.

460
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,227
Do you know what she was afraid of?

461
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,065
You.

462
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,400
Could you stop that? Please?

463
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,779
Stop that!

464
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,073
Please! Stop!

465
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,325
Do you know a patient
named Andrew Laeddis? Do you?

466
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,618
No! No.

467
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,745
- Boss. What's up?
- Fine.

468
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,830
- I wanna go back. I wanna go.
- Peter!

469
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,542
Come on! I got him. Peter! Peter!
Hey, Peter!

470
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,960
Go back.

471
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
- I wanna go back.
- Come on, Peter.

472
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,630
- I don't wanna see him.
- Easy now.

473
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,508
- I don't wanna see him anymore.
- It's okay. It's all right.

474
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,351
Oh, I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure that I should.

475
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,688
Excuse me for saying this,
Miss Kearns...

476
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,525
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Kearns.

477
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,113
But you seem quite normal.

478
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,407
I mean, in comparison
to the other patients here.

479
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:23,120
Well, I have my dark days.
I suppose everybody does.

480
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:28,542
The difference is most people
don't kill their husbands with an ax.

481
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,629
Although, personally,
I think if a man beats you

482
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:37,551
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

483
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:42,055
axing him isn't the least
understandable thing you could do.

484
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,016
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

485
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:50,981
What would I do if I did?
I don't know the world anymore.

486
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:55,777
They say there are bombs
that can reduce whole cities to ash.

487
00:35:55,862 --> 00:36:01,199
And what do you call them, televisions,
voices and faces coming from a box.

488
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,452
I hear enough voices already.

489
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,581
What can you tell us about Rachel?

490
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,670
Not much. She keeps to herself.

491
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:17,174
She believed her kids were alive.

492
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,302
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

493
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:25,348
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen...

494
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,975
Deliverymen.

495
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,604
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

496
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,274
Yes. He talked about anger.

497
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,238
Tell me about him. What's he like?

498
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:47,454
He's okay. Nice.

499
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,459
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

500
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:58,173
- Did he ever make a pass at you?
- No.

501
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,636
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never...

502
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,308
Could I have a glass of water, please?

503
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,809
No problem.

504
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,993
- Thank you, Marshal.
- Sure.

505
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:34,084
I just have one more question for you,
Mrs. Kearns.

506
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,632
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

507
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,886
No.

508
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,098
Never heard of him.

509
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,021
She was coached.

510
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,191
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

511
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,776
like she'd been told exactly what to say.

512
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,695
Who's Andrew Laeddis?

513
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,620
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

514
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,919
What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

515
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,879
We just met, Chuck.

516
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,883
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

517
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:28,388
What I'm doing,
it's not exactly by the book.

518
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,600
I don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

519
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,562
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

520
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,444
When this case came over the wires,

521
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,323
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

522
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,949
Why?

523
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,911
Andrew Laeddis,

524
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,914
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building

525
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,167
where my wife and I lived.

526
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,461
Okay.

527
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,340
He was also a firebug.

528
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,762
Andrew Laeddis lit the match

529
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,434
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

530
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,110
Let them out!

531
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,116
- What happened to Laeddis?
- He got away with it.

532
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,619
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

533
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,705
About a year ago, I open up the paper
and there he is.

534
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:40,293
Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scar
from his right temple down to his left lip.

535
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,838
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

536
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,050
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

537
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,885
said voices told him to do it.

538
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,596
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

539
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,890
- Then what?
- Then nothing.

540
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:57,727
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

541
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,188
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

542
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,564
Or he could be dead.

543
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,234
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

544
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,903
Lot of places to hide a body here.

545
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,615
Only one place
no one would really notice.

546
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:26,256
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

547
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,259
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

548
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,468
No.

549
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,680
Come on, boss.

550
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,102
She wrote it.

551
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,702
Boss!

552
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:59,622
We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into a fucking Kansas out here.

553
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,958
- Hold on.
- No, let's go!

554
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,296
Watch out!

555
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,632
Jesus!

556
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,678
- Come on! Up there!
- Let's go!

557
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,308
Get in there! Let's go!

558
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,146
Boss!

559
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,280
- God!
- Jesus Christ!

560
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,575
Damn it. God!

561
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,545
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

562
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:58,806
So if Laeddis is here,
what are you gonna do about it?

563
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,145
I'm not here to kill Laeddis.

564
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,571
If it was my wife, I'd kill him.

565
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,656
Twice.

566
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:30,046
When we got through the gates
at Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.

567
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:44,310
The Kommandant tried to kill himself
before we got there, but he...

568
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,771
He botched it.

569
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,316
Took him an hour to die.

570
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,158
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

571
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,331
Too many to count.

572
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,860
Too many to imagine.

573
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,197
So, yeah, the...

574
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,285
The guards surrendered,
we took their guns,

575
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,287
and we lined them up.

576
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,625
It wasn't warfare. It was...

577
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,170
It was murder.

578
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,593
Yeah, I've had enough of killing.

579
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,098
That's not why I'm here.

580
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,184
So what is this all about?

581
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:56,109
After Laeddis vanished, I started doing
some checking on Ashecliffe.

582
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,697
A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

583
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,742
You know, it's like it...
It's like they're scared or something.

584
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,872
You know, this place is funded
by a special grant

585
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,626
from The House
Un-American Activities Committee?

586
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,879
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting the communists

587
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,298
from an island in Boston Harbor?

588
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,552
By conducting experiments on the mind.

589
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,430
At least that's my guess.

590
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,223
And you think that's going on here?

591
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,809
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

592
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,562
Till I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

593
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:37,024
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

594
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,152
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

595
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,611
Guess what they were testing?

596
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,779
Toothpaste.

597
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,240
So, he starts
seeing dragons everywhere.

598
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:49,328
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

599
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,458
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

600
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:58,463
Two weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs three men to death.

601
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:03,968
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he...

602
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:08,514
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

603
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,726
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

604
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,811
And you found him.

605
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,563
Yeah, I found him.

606
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,149
Well, he's a mess.

607
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,861
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

608
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,070
What?

609
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,907
They're experimenting on people here.

610
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,700
I don't know, boss.

611
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,495
How do you believe a crazy guy?

612
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,246
That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

613
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:36,584
Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

614
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,836
I stood at Dachau.

615
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:43,758
We saw what human beings are
capable of doing to each other, right?

616
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,427
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

617
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:50,264
and now... Now I find out it may be
happening here? On our soil?

618
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,390
No.

619
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,186
So what are you really here to do, Ted?

620
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:59,690
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

621
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:03,444
and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place.
That's it.

622
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,364
Wait a minute.

623
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,742
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

624
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,244
waiting for a chance to get out here,

625
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,913
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

626
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,875
Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient
escape. It was the perfect excuse.

627
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,962
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

628
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,713
The world doesn't work that way.

629
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:26,092
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

630
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,303
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

631
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:33,057
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

632
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:37,728
I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

633
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,188
What if they wanted you here?

634
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,148
- Bullshit.
- You were asking questions.

635
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,275
- Bullshit! Bullshit!
- Bullshit.

636
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,609
We came here for Rachel Solando.

637
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,571
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

638
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,822
There's no way they could've known

639
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,282
I'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

640
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,702
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

641
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,997
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

642
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,874
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

643
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:06,465
Marshals, are you out here?
This is Deputy Warden McPherson.

644
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,634
Marshals!

645
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,720
How about that? They found us, huh?

646
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,306
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

647
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,309
I know you're in there.

648
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,397
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

649
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,486
- Come on!
- Go, go!

650
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,416
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

651
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:44,587
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

652
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,679
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

653
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,974
That is, if we all don't wash away first.

654
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:01,520
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

655
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,272
So...

656
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,068
This is our only choice, huh?

657
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:10,196
Got something really nice in
a prison gray if that don't work for you.

658
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,199
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

659
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,534
That's why I must repeat my insistence

660
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,746
that all Ward C patients
be placed in manual restraints.

661
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,750
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

662
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,460
That would take a lot of flooding.

663
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:27,213
We're on an island in the middle
of the ocean during a hurricane.

664
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,966
A lot of flooding seems like
a distinct possibility.

665
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,385
It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

666
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,719
There's a backup generator.

667
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,514
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

668
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,725
Where are they going to go?

669
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,396
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

670
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,480
Oh, you're quite right.

671
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,733
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

672
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,570
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

673
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,781
This is 24 human beings.

674
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,741
And you can live with that, can you?

675
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,910
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,

676
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,330
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B
in manual restraints as well.

677
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,291
- Excuse me! Excuse me.
- Marshal.

678
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,919
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one quick question.

679
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,212
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.

680
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:11,298
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note...

681
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,092
"The law of four". I love that.

682
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:16,721
...you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

683
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:22,226
"Who is 67?" Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

684
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,895
Nothing comes to mind?

685
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:28,816
Nothing?

686
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:37,825
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C

687
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,369
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

688
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,914
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

689
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,584
That is correct, yes.

690
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,132
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting

691
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,343
that you have a 67th patient, Doctor.

692
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,430
But I'm afraid we don't.

693
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,891
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

694
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,143
We're doing our goddamn job.

695
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,146
Didn't McPherson tell you
the good news?

696
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,733
No. What's the good news, Doctor?

697
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,568
Rachel's been found.

698
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,987
She's here.

699
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,656
Safe and sound.

700
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,378
There's not a mark on her.

701
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,425
Who are these men?

702
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,388
Why are they in my house?

703
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:45,976
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

704
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,689
Ma'am.

705
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:58,656
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

706
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,658
passing out literature.

707
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,661
Here?

708
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,498
In this neighborhood?

709
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,333
Yes, I'm afraid so.

710
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,296
Now if you could tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

711
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,507
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

712
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,385
Yes...

713
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,472
Well, I...

714
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,228
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

715
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,314
and then I

716
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,402
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

717
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,741
Then I sent the children off to school.

718
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,414
And then

719
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,882
I decided to take a long swim
in the lake.

720
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,973
I see.

721
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,228
And after that?

722
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,738
After that,

723
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,166
I thought of you.

724
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:42,134
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I don't know what you're talking about.

725
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:48,098
Don't you know how lonely
I've been, Jim?

726
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,147
You're gone.

727
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,861
You're dead.

728
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,785
I cry every night.

729
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,001
How am I supposed to survive?

730
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,671
God.

731
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,351
Rachel, it'll be all right.

732
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,648
I'm so sorry, but every...

733
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,194
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay?

734
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,572
I buried you.

735
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,536
I buried an empty casket.
Your body rained down,

736
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,123
lumps of flesh splashing into the sea,
eaten by sharks.

737
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,005
My Jim's dead,
so who the fuck are you?

738
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,093
Who the fuck are you?

739
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:07,970
- Who are you?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

740
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,638
- Who are you?
- It's okay. Rachel. Rachel, it's all right.

741
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,224
Let me go! No!

742
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,020
- Rachel, it's okay.
- Look at me, look at me.

743
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,234
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't want to interrupt.

744
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,653
I thought she might tell you something.

745
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,657
We found her down by the lighthouse,
skipping stones.

746
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,909
We've no idea how she got out, but...

747
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,370
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go down into the basement.

748
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,414
There's food, water and cots.

749
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,751
It's the safest place to be
when the hurricane hits.

750
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,257
Are you all right? You look pale.

751
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,134
I'm fine. It's just...

752
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,179
Boss, are you okay?

753
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,766
It's just so goddamn bright, isn't it?

754
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,018
Photosensitivity, headaches sometimes.

755
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,187
Marshal, are you having a migraine?

756
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,938
I'll be all right.

757
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,276
Come on, I got you.

758
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,696
What's wrong with him?

759
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,199
Take these, Marshal. Couple of hours,
you'll be as clear as a bell.

760
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,284
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a migraine.

761
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,661
Imagine someone sawed open
your head, filled it with razors,

762
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,456
and shook it as hard as they could.
Take the pills, Marshal.

763
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,666
- I don't... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain.

764
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,668
Marshal, take the pills.

765
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,633
He's going to need to lie down.

766
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,264
Oh, my God!

767
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,682
Michael, there's broken glass
all over the floor.

768
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,351
- Make sure all the meds are locked up.
- Watch your back.

769
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,435
Make sure everything's okay in Ward B.

770
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,020
Go down to the infirmary
and see if there's any more...

771
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,230
All right, Doctor.

772
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:45,109
Give him a bed. This one here.

773
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,779
- Over here. All right, boss.
- Yeah, that's it.

774
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,947
- You have him?
- Yes.

775
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,281
Careful. All right.

776
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:57,121
Could be worse right now.
He'll be all right.

777
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,585
Who is that?

778
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,171
Him? That's the warden.

779
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,926
Don't you worry about him, all right?

780
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,137
Come on. Lay back. Lay back.

781
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,644
He looks like an ex-military prick, huh?

782
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,688
Well, you know what?
I ain't gonna argue with you on that one.

783
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,443
You should have saved me.

784
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,739
You should have saved all of us.

785
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,520
Hey, buddy.

786
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,023
Hey.

787
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,400
Laeddis.

788
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,194
Yeah.

789
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,576
My...

790
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,164
My buddy.

791
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,626
No hard feelings, right?

792
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,631
Yeah.

793
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,843
No hard feelings.

794
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,483
A little something for later,

795
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,573
'cause I know how much you need it.

796
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:29,833
The clock's ticking, my friend.
We're running out of time.

797
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,429
Give me a hand here.

798
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,203
I could get into trouble.

799
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:35,941
I'm dead.

800
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,445
I'm so sorry.

801
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,116
Why didn't you save me?

802
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:50,747
I tried. I wanted to, but by the time
I got there, it was too late.

803
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:13,979
See?

804
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,151
Aren't they beautiful?

805
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,999
Why are you all wet, baby?

806
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,378
Laeddis isn't dead.

807
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,256
He isn't gone.

808
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,051
He's still here.

809
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,554
I know.

810
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:34,893
You need to find him, Teddy. You need
to find him and you kill him dead.

811
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:53,954
It's okay.

812
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,675
- Security to Ward A. Okay.
- Ward A. I got it.

813
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,760
The generator room's flooded.

814
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,096
- Ward A. Ward A.
- See what we need in Ward B.

815
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,681
Let's go.

816
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,558
You okay, boss?

817
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,187
This goddamn migraine.

818
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:23,149
The backup generator's failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

819
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,152
What do you want to do?

820
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,537
- Christ.
- Dan? Relax. Nope, nope, nope.

821
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,039
You don't wanna do that. Put it down.
Now. Put it down.

822
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:41,710
Grab him, grab him, grab him, grab him!
Get him, get him!

823
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,758
You need to go find him
'cause he needs to be here.

824
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,386
You think the whole electrical system
is fried?

825
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,222
I'd say it's a good possibility, yeah.

826
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,350
- All the electronic security, the fences...
- Why are you always running?

827
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,604
- ...the gates, the doors.
- Why is it you every time? Come on.

828
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:04,649
Nice day for a stroll, don't you think?
To Ward C, for example.

829
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,322
- Come on.
- Maybe we'll run into Andrew Laeddis.

830
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:18,288
The guy I told you about,
George Noyce?

831
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,082
He told me this is where
they keep the worst ones.

832
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,793
Guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

833
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,964
Did Noyce give you anything
on the layout?

834
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:31,801
Not really. All he remembered was
people screaming day and night,

835
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,596
no windows and iron bars everywhere.

836
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,847
Watch your head!

837
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,869
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Jesus.

838
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,497
First time on Ward C, huh?

839
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,249
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

840
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,376
We heard stories, but...

841
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,087
Trust me, son, you haven't heard shit.

842
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,714
We got most of the bugsies
locked down now,

843
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,967
but some of them are still loose.

844
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,761
And if you see one,
don't try to restrain him yourselves.

845
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:17,222
These fuckers will kill you. Clear?

846
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:21,226
All right, get your asses moving then.
Go on.

847
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,284
He's here.

848
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:26,708
Laeddis. I can feel him.

849
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:32,714
Tag! You're it!

850
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,799
Wait! Boss! Ted!

851
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,019
Hey! Hey!

852
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,646
Teddy.

853
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,065
Listen to me.

854
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:36,069
Listen, I don't wanna leave here,
all right?

855
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,738
I mean, why would anybody want to?

856
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,283
We hear things here
about the outside world.

857
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,787
- About atolls, about H-bomb tests.
- Teddy, where are you?

858
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,872
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?

859
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,209
- I know. With hydrogen! With hydrogen.
- Ah, that's funny.

860
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:54,212
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?

861
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,631
But not the hydrogen bomb.

862
01:08:56,715 --> 01:09:02,178
It implodes, creating an explosion
to the thousandth, the millionth degree!

863
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,264
- Do you get it?
- Yeah! Yeah.

864
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:05,932
- Do you?
- I get it, I get it!

865
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:07,267
Let him go!

866
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:11,980
No!

867
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,241
No! No!

868
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,411
What are you doing?

869
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,414
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

870
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:33,585
Oh, you got Billings. What the fuck's
the matter with you guys?

871
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:34,752
Catch them, not kill them!

872
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,797
- He jumped us.
- You, give me a hand with him.

873
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,300
We've gotta get him to the infirmary.
God damn it.

874
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:44,095
No, no! Not you, not you.
Take a walk. Come on.

875
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:47,098
Cawley's gonna have my goddamn balls
for this.

876
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,256
Laeddis.

877
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,070
Laeddis.

878
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:54,874
Stop me, please,

879
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,335
before I kill more.

880
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,839
Stop me before I kill more.

881
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,175
Laeddis.

882
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,185
Please, please.

883
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,400
I see you all.

884
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:24,529
Laeddis.

885
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:36,332
You told me I'd be free of this place.
You promised.

886
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,669
You lied.

887
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:41,546
Laeddis.

888
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:48,386
Laeddis?

889
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,889
That's pretty damn funny.

890
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,394
- Your voice.
- Don't you recognize it?

891
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,814
After all the talks we had?

892
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,775
After all the lies you told me?

893
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,652
Let me see your face.

894
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,113
They say I'm theirs now.

895
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,575
They say I'll never leave here.

896
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,995
Your match is about to go out.

897
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:19,334
- Let me see your goddamn face! Now!
- Why?

898
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:23,212
So you can lie to me more?
This isn't about the truth.

899
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:27,050
- Yes, it is. It's about exposing the truth.
- It's about you!

900
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:32,513
And Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about.

901
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:37,852
I was incidental. A way in.

902
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:45,693
George... George Noyce. No.

903
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:48,488
It's not possible. You can't be here.

904
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:49,947
You like it?

905
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:53,576
Who did this to you, George?

906
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,911
You did.

907
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,871
What the hell do you mean?

908
01:12:56,955 --> 01:13:01,125
All your talk. All your fucking talk,
and I'm back in here because of you.

909
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,795
George, how did they get you
out of Dedham, huh?

910
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,046
However this happened, I...

911
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,090
I'm gonna find a way to fix this,
you understand me?

912
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:11,052
I'll never get out now. I got out once.
Not twice, never twice.

913
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:13,012
Just tell me how they got you here.

914
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,807
They knew! Don't you get it?

915
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:19,268
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

916
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:23,731
This is a game. All of this is for you.

917
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:28,903
You're not investigating anything.
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

918
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,741
Georgie... George, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

919
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:37,954
Oh, really?
Been alone much since you got here?

920
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:41,666
I've been with my partner.

921
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:44,085
You never worked with him before,
have you?

922
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,881
He's a U.S. Marshal. He's...

923
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:51,801
You never worked with him before,
have you?

924
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:58,474
George, look, I know people.
I trust this man.

925
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,440
Then they've already won.

926
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:09,527
Fuck.

927
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,326
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

928
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,788
They're gonna cut into my brain.

929
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:25,626
And I'm only here because of you!

930
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,963
George, I'm gonna get you out of here.

931
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:31,299
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You're not.

932
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:34,135
You can't dig out the truth
and kill Laeddis at the same time.

933
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:37,805
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

934
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:39,974
I'm not here to kill anyone.

935
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,225
Liar!

936
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,395
I'm not gonna kill him, I swear to you!
I swear.

937
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,022
She's dead.

938
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:48,733
She... Let her go.

939
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:51,611
Let her go.

940
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,323
Tell him, Teddy. Tell him why.

941
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,245
You gotta do it. There's no other way.

942
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,372
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day

943
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:06,334
- you brought me my locket.
- You gotta do it!

944
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:09,837
How I told you my heart was breaking
and you asked me why.

945
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,798
She's fucking with your head.

946
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:14,759
And I told you it was from happiness.

947
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,303
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

948
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,601
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

949
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,438
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

950
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,398
I can't! I can't.

951
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,824
Then you'll never leave this island.

952
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:45,790
Dolores.

953
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,423
He's not in this ward.

954
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:59,637
He was transferred out of here.

955
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:06,644
If he's not in Ward A,
there's only one place he can be.

956
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:14,068
The lighthouse.

957
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,493
Hey,

958
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,497
God help you.

959
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,260
Boss, we got problems. McPherson
and Cawley are in the building.

960
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,095
They heard an orderly went batshit
on a patient.

961
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:44,056
They're looking all over the place for
him and they're on their way to the roof.

962
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:46,017
Let's get the hell out of here. This way.

963
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,355
Just keep going. We belong here.

964
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,992
What happened to you?

965
01:17:03,076 --> 01:17:04,702
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

966
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:06,621
where were you?

967
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:11,751
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.

968
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,961
Did you ever find Laeddis?

969
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:15,963
No. No, I never found him.

970
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:18,966
Well, I got the next best thing.
His intake form.

971
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:21,177
It was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

972
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:24,972
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. It was weird.

973
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,724
Here. Take a look.

974
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,893
I'll look at it later.

975
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,188
What's the matter, boss?

976
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,566
I'll look it over later, that's all.

977
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:40,905
- Ashecliffe's that way.
- I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

978
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:44,367
I'm going to that lighthouse.

979
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,786
I'm gonna find out what the fuck
is happening on this island.

980
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,343
There it is.

981
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:07,181
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

982
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:09,475
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

983
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:11,227
There could be a way
behind those trees.

984
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:14,397
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

985
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:15,523
- Boss...
- Come on.

986
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:17,983
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

987
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:19,860
It's proof there's a 67th patient,

988
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,780
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

989
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,450
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

990
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,496
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

991
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,873
Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

992
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,792
Because climbing down there
when it's dark

993
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:38,045
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

994
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,549
Okay, maybe you better sit
this one out then.

995
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:46,429
You brought me into this, boss,
and now we're trapped here

996
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:50,182
on this rock, on this island,
with no one to rely on but each other,

997
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,226
and now you're acting like...

998
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,312
Like what? Like what? How am I acting?

999
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,612
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

1000
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:11,579
What do you think the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck?

1001
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:13,330
I'm from Seattle.

1002
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:17,209
Seattle.

1003
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,174
I'm going on alone.

1004
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,971
- I'm going with you, boss.
- I said alone.

1005
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:31,807
Fine.

1006
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,710
Damn it!

1007
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:02,004
Damn it.

1008
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,095
I knew it wouldn't take long,
but I couldn't get to it.

1009
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,722
The tide was up.

1010
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,106
Chuck!

1011
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:24,819
Chuck!

1012
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:27,631
Come on!

1013
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,168
Chuck!

1014
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,670
Where are you, Chuck?

1015
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,529
Chuck!

1016
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,407
Chuck!

1017
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:21,286
Who are you?

1018
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,250
I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop.

1019
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:29,336
You're the marshal.

1020
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,797
That's right.

1021
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:38,012
Would you mind taking your hand
from behind your back, please?

1022
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:39,930
Why? Why?

1023
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,435
I wanna make sure that
what you're holding won't hurt me.

1024
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,819
I'm gonna keep this

1025
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:56,822
if you don't mind.

1026
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:59,074
Fine by me.

1027
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,460
You're...

1028
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,713
You're Rachel Solando.

1029
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,716
The real one.

1030
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,346
Did you kill your children?

1031
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:24,975
I never had children.

1032
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:27,436
I was never married.

1033
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:32,524
And before I was a patient at Ashecliffe,
I worked here.

1034
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,736
You... You were a nurse?

1035
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,032
I was a doctor, Marshal.

1036
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,162
You think I'm crazy.

1037
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:48,874
- No. No, no, I never...
- And if I say I'm not crazy?

1038
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,503
Well, that hardly helps, does it?

1039
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,839
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1040
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:01,428
People tell the world you're crazy,

1041
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:05,432
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

1042
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:09,186
I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

1043
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,772
Once you're declared insane,

1044
01:25:11,856 --> 01:25:15,359
then anything you do
is called part of that insanity.

1045
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:21,031
Reasonable protests are denial.
Valid fears, paranoia.

1046
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:25,202
Survival instincts
are defense mechanisms.

1047
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:29,206
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1048
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,542
Tell me something.

1049
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:32,751
Yeah.

1050
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,712
What happened to you?

1051
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,967
I started asking about these
large shipments of sodium amytal

1052
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:41,802
and opium-based hallucinogens.

1053
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:43,595
Psychotropic drugs.

1054
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,349
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1055
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,562
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1056
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:55,816
They zap the patient with electroshock,

1057
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,735
then go through the eye with an ice pick,

1058
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:02,990
pull out some nerve fibers.

1059
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,870
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1060
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:09,288
Tractable.

1061
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:12,249
It's barbaric,

1062
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,751
unconscionable.

1063
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:19,506
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1064
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:22,217
Depends on where you're hurt?

1065
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:27,472
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.
The brain controls pain.

1066
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:32,477
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

1067
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:36,607
What if you could control it?

1068
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,567
You mean the brain?

1069
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:45,449
Recreate a man so he doesn't feel
pain or love or sympathy.

1070
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,368
A man who can't be interrogated,

1071
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:51,163
because he has no memories
to confess.

1072
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:57,419
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

1073
01:26:57,503 --> 01:27:01,632
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1074
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:03,383
during their brainwashing experiments.

1075
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:06,887
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1076
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:09,056
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world

1077
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,392
and do things sane men...
Sane men never would.

1078
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:15,812
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1079
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:18,148
- that would take years.
- Years. Years of research.

1080
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,360
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1081
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:25,030
Fifty years from now,
people will look back

1082
01:27:25,114 --> 01:27:28,492
and say, here, this place,
is where it all began.

1083
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:33,997
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags,

1084
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:38,293
and we tested patients
on Shutter Island.

1085
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:41,630
No, they won't.

1086
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,590
No.

1087
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:48,178
You do understand

1088
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:53,016
that they can't let you leave.

1089
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:56,645
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1090
01:27:58,022 --> 01:28:03,110
I was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

1091
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:06,822
Didn't matter.

1092
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:11,118
Let me ask you.

1093
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:13,578
Any past traumas in your life?

1094
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,206
Yes.

1095
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,459
But why would that matter?

1096
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:21,837
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past

1097
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:24,423
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1098
01:28:24,507 --> 01:28:29,886
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1099
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,888
"Of course he cracked.

1100
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,141
"Who wouldn't after what
he'd been through?"

1101
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:36,727
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1102
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:39,771
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

1103
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:44,651
How's your head?

1104
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:46,820
My head?

1105
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:50,324
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1106
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:56,872
- Headaches?
- I am prone to migraines, yes.

1107
01:28:56,956 --> 01:28:58,248
Jesus.

1108
01:29:00,543 --> 01:29:04,046
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
I mean, even aspirin?

1109
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:06,298
- The aspirin?
- Jesus.

1110
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:10,677
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

1111
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:14,139
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

1112
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:17,142
No.

1113
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:19,227
No.

1114
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:21,688
No, I haven't.

1115
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,524
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1116
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:27,194
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1117
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:30,822
Palsy comes first,

1118
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:35,202
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1119
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:40,290
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, Marshal?

1120
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:45,754
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.

1121
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:47,964
Tell me.

1122
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:50,759
Brain surgery.

1123
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:55,889
The let's-open-the-skull-and-see-
what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

1124
01:29:56,432 --> 01:29:59,309
The learned-it-from-the-Nazis kind.

1125
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,855
That's where they create the ghosts.

1126
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:09,152
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

1127
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:12,739
Everyone.

1128
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:16,535
Come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1129
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,414
- They couldn't possibly know...
- Everyone.

1130
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:40,892
You can't stay here.

1131
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:42,811
They think I'm dead, that I drowned.

1132
01:30:42,895 --> 01:30:45,897
I'm afraid if they come looking for you,
they might find me.

1133
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:48,358
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1134
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,616
I'm gonna come back for you.

1135
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:59,661
I won't be here. I move during the day.
New places every night.

1136
01:30:59,745 --> 01:31:02,080
But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

1137
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:04,875
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1138
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:09,087
The only way off the island is the ferry,
and they control it.

1139
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,214
You'll never leave here.

1140
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,350
I had a friend.

1141
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:25,979
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1142
01:31:26,063 --> 01:31:27,731
Have you seen him?

1143
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,233
Marshal,

1144
01:31:31,777 --> 01:31:33,904
you have no friends.

1145
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:07,771
There you are.

1146
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:13,276
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

1147
01:32:14,904 --> 01:32:16,446
Have a seat.

1148
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:18,198
Come on.

1149
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:31,503
Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?

1150
01:32:32,588 --> 01:32:35,632
I was just looking around.

1151
01:32:38,594 --> 01:32:41,012
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1152
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,974
- What?
- God's gift.

1153
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:47,477
The violence.

1154
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:54,693
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1155
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:58,613
it reached out for me like a divine hand.

1156
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:02,659
God loves violence.

1157
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:08,164
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

1158
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:14,462
Why else would there be so much of it?
It's in us. It's what we are.

1159
01:33:16,507 --> 01:33:18,842
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1160
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:21,469
and pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh of our brothers.

1161
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:25,473
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

1162
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:31,104
I thought God gave us moral order.

1163
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:34,190
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1164
01:33:34,817 --> 01:33:37,110
There's no moral order at all.

1165
01:33:37,403 --> 01:33:40,947
There's just this,
can my violence conquer yours?

1166
01:33:46,537 --> 01:33:48,955
- I'm not violent.
- Yes, you are.

1167
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:52,500
You're as violent as they come.

1168
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:56,796
I know this
because I'm as violent as they come.

1169
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,049
If the constraints of society were lifted,

1170
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:01,801
and I was all that stood
between you and a meal,

1171
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:05,680
you would crack my skull with a rock
and eat my meaty parts.

1172
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:08,808
Wouldn't you?

1173
01:34:11,562 --> 01:34:14,022
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

1174
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:15,982
but I know different.

1175
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:18,360
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

1176
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:21,613
- No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
- Oh, I know you.

1177
01:34:21,697 --> 01:34:24,407
We've known each other for centuries.

1178
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:36,670
If I was to sink my teeth
into your eye right now,

1179
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:40,090
would you be able to stop me
before I blinded you?

1180
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:45,845
Give it a try.

1181
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:49,099
That's the spirit.

1182
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:26,469
Don't worry, because we're going
to get you back to your room.

1183
01:35:28,097 --> 01:35:29,764
- Not really.
- Something I've seen.

1184
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:31,099
Okay.

1185
01:35:36,313 --> 01:35:38,064
Where have you been?

1186
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:40,900
Oh, just wandering.
Just looking at your island.

1187
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:44,654
Oh, I forgot you're leaving
now that Rachel's been found.

1188
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:46,906
- Stop looking at him.
- For sure. Yeah.

1189
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:50,243
Stop looking at him. Stop looking at him.

1190
01:35:50,327 --> 01:35:52,328
- Big meeting?
- Oh, yes.

1191
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:54,080
- It's okay. I'm...
- I don't like that.

1192
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:56,166
Apparently there was
an unidentified man

1193
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,542
in Ward C yesterday.

1194
01:35:57,626 --> 01:36:01,004
He subdued a highly dangerous patient
quite handily.

1195
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:02,589
Is that so?

1196
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:05,133
It seems he had a long conversation
with a paranoid schizophrenic,

1197
01:36:05,217 --> 01:36:06,426
George Noyce.

1198
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:09,304
Well, I don't remember
what I'm supposed to remember.

1199
01:36:09,388 --> 01:36:11,097
We're gated down. We're fine.

1200
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:15,226
This Noyce, you said
his name was, he's delusional?

1201
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:18,021
Extremely. He can be quite upsetting.

1202
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:19,814
As a matter of fact, two weeks ago,

1203
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:24,360
a patient got so wound up by one
of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

1204
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:27,030
Cigarette?

1205
01:36:28,824 --> 01:36:30,617
No, thanks. I quit.

1206
01:36:31,702 --> 01:36:35,747
- So you're taking the ferry?
- Yes, absolutely.

1207
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:39,292
I think we've gotten
all we came here for, so...

1208
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:40,710
"We," Marshal?

1209
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:46,299
Speaking of which,
have you seen him, Doctor?

1210
01:36:46,383 --> 01:36:47,550
Who?

1211
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:50,094
My partner, Chuck.

1212
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:55,266
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1213
01:36:57,728 --> 01:36:59,896
You know, I've built
something valuable here,

1214
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:03,149
and valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1215
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:05,318
Everyone wants a quick fix.
They always have.

1216
01:37:05,402 --> 01:37:08,988
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1217
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:12,033
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1218
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:15,495
I can see that.

1219
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:22,210
So, tell me again about your partner.

1220
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,547
What partner?

1221
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:29,384
It's fine.

1222
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:21,519
She made a mess. I cleaned it up.
She made a mess again.

1223
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,196
Marshal,

1224
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,199
going somewhere?

1225
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:38,661
I'm just heading out to the ferry, so...

1226
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:42,707
Oh, well, I'm afraid it's the other way.

1227
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:50,340
If you'll wait a moment, I'll find you
someone who can take you to the dock.

1228
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:58,848
- What's this, Doctor? What's this?
- It's just a sedative.

1229
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:02,101
- A precaution.
- A precaution.

1230
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:09,108
What are you going to do?
Kill me? Marshal.

1231
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:11,027
You think you deserve it?

1232
01:39:11,111 --> 01:39:13,905
For what? Provoking you?

1233
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:17,533
Well, forgive me.
What doesn't provoke you?

1234
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:21,204
- Remarks? Words?
- Nazis?

1235
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:25,708
Well, that, too.
And, of course, memories, dreams.

1236
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:31,047
Did you know that the word "trauma"
comes from the Greek for "wound"?

1237
01:39:31,715 --> 01:39:34,467
And what is the German word
for "dream"?

1238
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:41,057
Wounds can create monsters,
and you...

1239
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:44,102
You are wounded, Marshal.

1240
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:48,314
And wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster,

1241
01:39:49,024 --> 01:39:50,775
you must stop it?

1242
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,568
Yeah.

1243
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:55,571
- I agree.
- Yes.

1244
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:57,490
Yeah.

1245
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:16,968
I told him that we'd take
about an hour to do it.

1246
01:40:17,052 --> 01:40:20,138
Yeah. Did they say
we're going to do the first floor?

1247
01:40:20,222 --> 01:40:21,472
How long you been on the clock?

1248
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:25,268
- I've been on for 18 hours straight.
- Nice paycheck.

1249
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:44,495
What are you doing, baby?

1250
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:51,794
- You gotta get to the ferry.
- No.

1251
01:40:52,546 --> 01:40:53,838
No, no.

1252
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,215
Yeah.

1253
01:40:57,342 --> 01:41:02,221
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he's perfect for their experiments.

1254
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,558
There's only one place they'd take him.

1255
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:09,812
You go there and you'll die.

1256
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:11,564
He's my partner. If they are hurting him,

1257
01:41:11,648 --> 01:41:14,817
if they're holding him against his will,
I've gotta bring him out.

1258
01:41:14,902 --> 01:41:16,944
I can't lose anyone else.

1259
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:18,279
Don't go, Teddy, please.

1260
01:41:18,363 --> 01:41:21,783
- Please, don't do this. Don't go.
- I'm sorry, honey.

1261
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:27,163
I'm sorry, honey.

1262
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:31,292
I love this thing
because you gave it to me,

1263
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:35,505
but the truth is

1264
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:39,342
it is one fucking ugly tie.

1265
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:20,716
No.

1266
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,008
Don't move. Stay where you are.

1267
01:43:46,011 --> 01:43:47,428
Are you gonna kill me?

1268
01:43:49,097 --> 01:43:51,641
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

1269
01:45:44,254 --> 01:45:46,130
Why are you all wet, baby?

1270
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:51,594
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

1271
01:46:04,691 --> 01:46:06,942
The rifle's empty, by the way.

1272
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:14,950
Have a seat.

1273
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:23,876
For God's sake, dry off.
You'll catch cold.

1274
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:26,629
All right.

1275
01:46:30,175 --> 01:46:32,093
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1276
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:36,806
I don't know what you're talking about.

1277
01:46:39,976 --> 01:46:41,894
Yes, he's here.

1278
01:46:41,978 --> 01:46:45,981
Have Dr. Sheehan take a look at
your man before you send him up.

1279
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:50,778
So Dr. Sheehan came in
on the ferry this morning, huh?

1280
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:53,239
Not exactly.

1281
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:57,326
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1282
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:00,329
Sorry to hear about that.

1283
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:06,001
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1284
01:47:06,628 --> 01:47:09,046
How are the hallucinations?

1285
01:47:09,131 --> 01:47:11,424
Get out of here, Teddy.

1286
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:13,300
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1287
01:47:17,055 --> 01:47:18,180
Not bad.

1288
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:20,850
- They'll get worse.
- I know.

1289
01:47:21,726 --> 01:47:26,021
Dr. Solando,
she told me about the neuroleptics.

1290
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:29,024
Did she, now? And when was this?

1291
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:33,904
I found her, Doctor,
in a cave out by the cliffs.

1292
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:35,364
But you'll never get to her.

1293
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:38,868
I don't doubt it,
considering she's not real.

1294
01:47:41,079 --> 01:47:44,206
Your delusions are more severe
than I thought.

1295
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:47,585
You're not on neuroleptics.

1296
01:47:48,044 --> 01:47:49,920
You're not on anything,
as a matter of fact.

1297
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:52,631
Then what the fuck is this?
What the fuck is this?

1298
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:53,716
Withdrawal.

1299
01:47:54,718 --> 01:47:56,677
Withdrawal? From what?

1300
01:47:56,761 --> 01:47:59,096
I haven't had a goddamn drink
since I've been on this island.

1301
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,806
Chlorpromazine.

1302
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:05,311
I'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but I have to say, in your case...

1303
01:48:05,395 --> 01:48:08,647
- Chloraproma-what?
- Chlorpromazine.

1304
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:12,735
The same thing we've been giving you
for the past 24 months.

1305
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:16,155
So for the past two years, you...

1306
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:19,533
You've had somebody slipping me drugs
in Boston. Is that it?

1307
01:48:19,618 --> 01:48:21,076
Not Boston.

1308
01:48:21,578 --> 01:48:22,745
Here.

1309
01:48:23,538 --> 01:48:27,500
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1310
01:48:31,254 --> 01:48:35,007
After everything I've seen here, Doctor,

1311
01:48:35,091 --> 01:48:38,511
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy?

1312
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:40,554
Do you know the kind of people
that I deal with every day?

1313
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:42,515
I'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes.

1314
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:44,475
You were a U.S. Marshal.

1315
01:48:44,559 --> 01:48:48,354
Here's a copy of the intake form
you broke into Ward C for.

1316
01:48:48,438 --> 01:48:49,813
Proof of the 67th patient.

1317
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:51,065
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,

1318
01:48:51,149 --> 01:48:52,942
you could have
blown the lid off this place.

1319
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:54,151
Wait. Where did... Where did you...

1320
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:56,028
Yet somehow,
you couldn't find time to look at it.

1321
01:48:56,112 --> 01:48:57,821
Well, read it now.

1322
01:48:58,281 --> 01:48:59,657
Go ahead.

1323
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:07,289
"Patient is highly intelligent, highly
delusional decorated Army veteran.

1324
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:11,126
"Present for the liberation of Dachau.

1325
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:13,837
"Former U.S. Marshal.
Known proclivity for violence.

1326
01:49:13,922 --> 01:49:17,174
"Shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies the crime ever...

1327
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:18,300
"Ever took place.

1328
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:20,261
"Highly developed
and fantastical narratives,

1329
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:22,721
"which preclude facing
the truth of his actions."

1330
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:23,889
I've had enough of this bullshit!

1331
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:27,851
Where's my partner? Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

1332
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,645
Let's try this another way.

1333
01:49:29,729 --> 01:49:32,273
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am I correct?

1334
01:49:32,357 --> 01:49:33,774
Don't you even talk about her.
Don't you...

1335
01:49:33,858 --> 01:49:35,734
I'm afraid I have to.

1336
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:42,032
Notice anything these four names
have in common? It's your rule of four.

1337
01:49:42,117 --> 01:49:43,242
Andrew, what do you see?

1338
01:49:43,326 --> 01:49:46,328
If you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of...

1339
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:48,831
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

1340
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:52,334
The names have the same letters.

1341
01:49:53,211 --> 01:49:56,630
Edward Daniels has exactly
the same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

1342
01:49:56,715 --> 01:49:58,924
The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1343
01:49:59,009 --> 01:50:01,093
The names are anagrams
for each other.

1344
01:50:01,177 --> 01:50:03,762
Your tactics,
they're not gonna work on me.

1345
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:06,640
You came here for the truth. Here it is.

1346
01:50:06,725 --> 01:50:08,726
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1347
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:12,354
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1348
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:15,149
Bullshit.

1349
01:50:15,233 --> 01:50:17,443
You were committed here by court order
24 months ago.

1350
01:50:17,527 --> 01:50:20,863
Your crime is terrible,
one you can't forgive yourself for,

1351
01:50:20,947 --> 01:50:23,324
so you invented another self.

1352
01:50:25,493 --> 01:50:26,910
All right.

1353
01:50:27,412 --> 01:50:30,080
Let's get down to the facts, all right?

1354
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:33,042
You've created a story
in which you're not a murderer.

1355
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:35,169
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal,

1356
01:50:35,253 --> 01:50:37,171
only here at Ashecliffe
because of a case,

1357
01:50:37,255 --> 01:50:40,591
and you've uncovered a conspiracy
so that anything we tell you

1358
01:50:40,675 --> 01:50:44,511
about who you are, what you've done,
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1359
01:50:44,596 --> 01:50:45,888
My name is Edward Daniels.

1360
01:50:45,972 --> 01:50:50,225
I've been hearing this fantasy for
two years now. I know every detail.

1361
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:52,269
Patient 67, the storm,

1362
01:50:52,354 --> 01:50:55,564
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

1363
01:50:55,649 --> 01:50:58,067
You were at Dachau,
but you may not have killed any guards.

1364
01:51:02,113 --> 01:51:05,783
I wish I could let you just live
in your fantasy world.

1365
01:51:05,867 --> 01:51:07,326
I really do.

1366
01:51:08,203 --> 01:51:10,412
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.

1367
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:12,790
You're the most dangerous patient
we have.

1368
01:51:12,874 --> 01:51:15,167
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1369
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:17,169
Two weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

1370
01:51:17,253 --> 01:51:19,505
No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor.

1371
01:51:19,589 --> 01:51:21,465
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't!

1372
01:51:21,549 --> 01:51:23,634
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1373
01:51:23,718 --> 01:51:26,095
Because he called you Laeddis,

1374
01:51:26,179 --> 01:51:29,223
and you'd do anything not to be him.

1375
01:51:29,307 --> 01:51:32,893
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1376
01:51:32,977 --> 01:51:37,022
"This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

1377
01:51:38,942 --> 01:51:41,443
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

1378
01:51:41,528 --> 01:51:43,404
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1379
01:51:43,488 --> 01:51:46,865
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this".

1380
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:49,076
No, no, he meant that it was my fault.

1381
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,161
You almost killed him.

1382
01:51:52,831 --> 01:51:55,624
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

1383
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:57,418
It's been decided

1384
01:51:57,502 --> 01:52:02,131
that unless we can bring you
back to sanity now, right now,

1385
01:52:02,215 --> 01:52:05,634
permanent measures will be taken to
ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1386
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:12,474
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?

1387
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:18,647
Yeah, I understand.

1388
01:52:19,482 --> 01:52:21,692
I understand just fine.

1389
01:52:22,318 --> 01:52:26,405
If I don't play along
with your little game here,

1390
01:52:26,489 --> 01:52:29,616
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

1391
01:52:30,076 --> 01:52:31,452
But what about my partner?

1392
01:52:31,536 --> 01:52:35,998
You gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1393
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:39,334
Hello, boss.

1394
01:52:56,186 --> 01:52:58,979
What the fuck is going on here?

1395
01:53:01,858 --> 01:53:05,486
You working for him?

1396
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:07,821
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

1397
01:53:07,906 --> 01:53:10,824
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

1398
01:53:13,703 --> 01:53:15,829
You been watching me, huh?

1399
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:18,874
Watching me every minute.

1400
01:53:19,793 --> 01:53:22,795
Who are you? Who are you? Tell me.

1401
01:53:23,588 --> 01:53:25,589
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1402
01:53:27,008 --> 01:53:30,719
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1403
01:53:31,304 --> 01:53:33,180
I'm Lester Sheehan.

1404
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:42,314
- I told you... I told you about my wife, I...
- I know.

1405
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:45,651
I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I trusted you.

1406
01:53:45,735 --> 01:53:49,363
I risked everything to come
in here after you. Everything!

1407
01:53:49,447 --> 01:53:50,489
I know, boss.

1408
01:53:50,573 --> 01:53:53,367
We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1409
01:53:53,743 --> 01:53:55,327
I swore before the Board of Overseers

1410
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:59,331
that I could construct the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play

1411
01:53:59,415 --> 01:54:01,667
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1412
01:54:01,751 --> 01:54:04,795
I thought that if we let you play this out

1413
01:54:04,879 --> 01:54:08,507
we could get you to see
how untrue, how impossible it is.

1414
01:54:09,592 --> 01:54:12,052
You've had the run of the place
for two days.

1415
01:54:12,136 --> 01:54:15,430
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

1416
01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:17,307
The satanic ORs?

1417
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:32,823
Andrew, listen to me.

1418
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:37,452
If we fail with you,

1419
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:41,456
then everything that we've tried to do
here will be discredited. Everything.

1420
01:54:43,585 --> 01:54:46,753
We're on the front lines
of a war here, old boy.

1421
01:54:47,505 --> 01:54:50,382
And right now, it all comes down to you.

1422
01:54:57,307 --> 01:55:00,017
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

1423
01:55:00,101 --> 01:55:03,312
My name is Edward Daniels!

1424
01:55:03,396 --> 01:55:05,439
This one's loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1425
01:55:05,523 --> 01:55:08,108
I see. And that's your firearm, Marshal?
You're sure?

1426
01:55:08,192 --> 01:55:09,401
My initials are on the side.

1427
01:55:09,485 --> 01:55:11,778
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1428
01:55:11,863 --> 01:55:13,989
You're not gonna fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

1429
01:55:14,073 --> 01:55:15,115
Then blast away.

1430
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:18,535
Because that's the only way
you're ever getting off this island.

1431
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:26,501
Andrew, please don't.

1432
01:55:37,388 --> 01:55:38,680
My gun.

1433
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:47,856
What did you do to my goddamn gun?

1434
01:55:48,274 --> 01:55:49,441
It's a toy, Andrew.

1435
01:55:52,946 --> 01:55:55,030
We're telling you the truth.

1436
01:55:55,531 --> 01:55:58,784
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal.

1437
01:55:59,452 --> 01:56:02,537
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

1438
01:56:02,622 --> 01:56:03,747
You moved to that lake house

1439
01:56:03,831 --> 01:56:06,959
after she purposely set
your city apartment on fire.

1440
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:08,335
- You were...
- You're lying.

1441
01:56:08,419 --> 01:56:11,880
- Andrew! Andrew, stop. No.
- You drugged the cigarettes!

1442
01:56:11,965 --> 01:56:13,799
- All you've done is lie!
- Andrew. Andrew.

1443
01:56:13,883 --> 01:56:17,094
Your children. Andrew, your children.

1444
01:56:17,178 --> 01:56:19,846
Simon. Henry.

1445
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:21,515
I never had any children.

1446
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:25,644
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

1447
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:28,939
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1448
01:56:29,649 --> 01:56:31,316
every night.

1449
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:32,567
I never had a little girl.

1450
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:36,238
The one who tells you over and over
that you should have saved her,

1451
01:56:36,322 --> 01:56:38,240
saved them all.

1452
01:56:38,324 --> 01:56:40,784
Your daughter, her name was Rachel.

1453
01:56:40,868 --> 01:56:43,745
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1454
01:56:44,497 --> 01:56:46,248
Andrew, are you?

1455
01:57:09,230 --> 01:57:11,314
I'm so sorry, baby.

1456
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:18,071
I told you not to come in here.

1457
01:57:18,531 --> 01:57:22,492
I told you this would be the end of you.

1458
01:57:42,847 --> 01:57:44,181
I'm back!

1459
01:57:44,807 --> 01:57:47,559
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.

1460
01:57:47,643 --> 01:57:50,187
Must've stopped 10 places
in between here and Tulsa.

1461
01:57:50,271 --> 01:57:52,355
I could sleep for a week.

1462
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:57,652
Dolores?

1463
01:58:04,535 --> 01:58:05,869
Dolores?

1464
01:58:10,666 --> 01:58:12,959
And he said, "Take up your bed
and walk". But God?

1465
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:14,086
Dolores?

1466
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:18,256
Then he said, "Take up your bed
and walk". Forgive sins, but God?

1467
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:29,893
Dolores?

1468
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:56,461
Baby,

1469
01:58:58,506 --> 01:59:00,382
why are you all wet?

1470
01:59:02,718 --> 01:59:04,261
I missed you.

1471
01:59:11,644 --> 01:59:13,311
I wanna go home.

1472
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,941
You are home.

1473
01:59:23,114 --> 01:59:24,948
Where are the kids?

1474
01:59:28,995 --> 01:59:30,745
They're in school.

1475
01:59:34,917 --> 01:59:36,918
It's Saturday, honey.

1476
01:59:38,087 --> 01:59:40,297
School's not in on Saturday.

1477
01:59:42,925 --> 01:59:44,551
My school is.

1478
01:59:57,899 --> 01:59:59,441
Oh, my God.

1479
02:00:01,736 --> 02:00:03,195
Oh, my God!

1480
02:00:16,334 --> 02:00:19,044
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1481
02:00:23,216 --> 02:00:24,799
Oh, my God, no.

1482
02:00:29,263 --> 02:00:30,972
Come on, come on.

1483
02:00:44,195 --> 02:00:47,322
No. No. Please, God.

1484
02:00:49,325 --> 02:00:53,119
Please, God, no! No!

1485
02:00:56,332 --> 02:00:57,457
No.

1486
02:01:02,964 --> 02:01:04,089
No.

1487
02:01:06,592 --> 02:01:07,842
No.

1488
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:53,430
Baby.

1489
02:02:12,241 --> 02:02:14,743
Let's put them at the table, Andrew.

1490
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:18,788
We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

1491
02:02:20,958 --> 02:02:23,084
They'll be our living dolls.

1492
02:02:27,423 --> 02:02:30,175
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1493
02:02:35,181 --> 02:02:39,684
If you ever loved me, Dolores,
please stop talking.

1494
02:02:46,275 --> 02:02:47,776
I love you.

1495
02:02:56,494 --> 02:02:58,078
Set me free.

1496
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:04,167
Oh, baby.

1497
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:09,547
We'll give them baths.

1498
02:03:12,802 --> 02:03:16,012
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

1499
02:03:16,097 --> 02:03:17,889
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

1500
02:03:17,973 --> 02:03:19,724
I love you. I...

1501
02:03:43,582 --> 02:03:45,333
Oh, baby.

1502
02:03:51,298 --> 02:03:52,632
Andrew.

1503
02:03:54,677 --> 02:03:56,678
Andrew, can you hear me?

1504
02:03:56,971 --> 02:03:58,304
Rachel.

1505
02:03:59,181 --> 02:04:00,849
Rachel, Rachel.

1506
02:04:03,102 --> 02:04:04,394
Rachel?

1507
02:04:06,897 --> 02:04:08,356
Rachel who?

1508
02:04:11,235 --> 02:04:13,319
Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.

1509
02:04:14,488 --> 02:04:16,239
My daughter.

1510
02:04:19,827 --> 02:04:21,578
Why are you here?

1511
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:26,332
Because I killed my wife.

1512
02:04:26,417 --> 02:04:28,543
And why did you do that?

1513
02:04:32,047 --> 02:04:35,216
Because she murdered our children,

1514
02:04:38,137 --> 02:04:39,554
and she told me to let her go.

1515
02:04:43,726 --> 02:04:46,895
- Who's Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

1516
02:04:49,231 --> 02:04:51,691
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1517
02:04:51,775 --> 02:04:53,026
Why?

1518
02:04:54,361 --> 02:04:56,529
We need to hear you say it.

1519
02:05:02,328 --> 02:05:05,538
After she tried to kill herself
the first time,

1520
02:05:07,583 --> 02:05:09,542
Dolores told me she...

1521
02:05:10,503 --> 02:05:14,756
She had an insect living
inside her brain.

1522
02:05:16,759 --> 02:05:21,471
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

1523
02:05:21,555 --> 02:05:25,767
just pulling the wires just for fun.

1524
02:05:29,438 --> 02:05:31,231
She told me that.

1525
02:05:32,691 --> 02:05:35,527
She told me that, but I didn't listen.

1526
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:41,533
I loved her so much, you know.

1527
02:05:42,952 --> 02:05:45,119
Why did you make them up?

1528
02:05:47,206 --> 02:05:51,125
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1529
02:05:54,964 --> 02:05:56,297
And I...

1530
02:05:58,801 --> 02:06:03,304
I killed them 'cause I didn't get her help,
you know.

1531
02:06:07,518 --> 02:06:09,143
I killed them.

1532
02:06:13,941 --> 02:06:15,066
Here's my fear, Andrew.

1533
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:18,361
We broke through once before,
nine months ago,

1534
02:06:18,445 --> 02:06:19,445
and then you regressed.

1535
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:25,326
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

1536
02:06:26,829 --> 02:06:28,621
You reset, Andrew.

1537
02:06:29,081 --> 02:06:33,167
Like a tape playing over and over
on an endless loop.

1538
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:35,878
I hope that what we've done here
will be enough

1539
02:06:35,963 --> 02:06:39,090
to stop it from ever happening again,

1540
02:06:39,174 --> 02:06:42,677
but I need to know
you've accepted reality.

1541
02:06:49,184 --> 02:06:51,936
You came after me, huh, Doctor?

1542
02:06:53,814 --> 02:06:57,692
You tried to help me
when no one else would.

1543
02:07:09,496 --> 02:07:12,373
My name's Andrew Laeddis,

1544
02:07:19,381 --> 02:07:22,842
and I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1545
02:07:47,576 --> 02:07:51,037
- How we doing this morning?
- Good.

1546
02:07:51,121 --> 02:07:54,040
- And you?
- Can't complain.

1547
02:08:03,717 --> 02:08:07,679
- So what's our next move?
- You tell me.

1548
02:08:13,268 --> 02:08:17,563
We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.
Get back to the mainland.

1549
02:08:17,648 --> 02:08:20,608
Whatever the hell's going on here,
it's bad.

1550
02:08:42,548 --> 02:08:45,758
Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

1551
02:08:51,306 --> 02:08:54,142
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1552
02:08:55,269 --> 02:08:57,395
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1553
02:09:13,036 --> 02:09:15,788
You know,
this place makes me wonder...

1554
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:18,416
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1555
02:09:19,376 --> 02:09:21,335
Which would be worse,

1556
02:09:22,171 --> 02:09:26,299
to live as a monster
or to die as a good man?

1557
02:09:36,143 --> 02:09:37,435
Teddy?
