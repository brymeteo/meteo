- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

10
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,710
I just can't...
Can't stomach the water.

00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,883
- You're my new partner.
- That's right.

12
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,970
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

13
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:19,098
Doesn't exactly square with
"Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,".

- I'll give you that.
- The legend?

What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

Seattle. I came from
the office in Seattle.

How long you been
with the Marshals?

18
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,238
Four years.

19
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,159
So you know how small it is.

- Jesus. I don't...
- Don't worry about it.

27
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:07,814
There was a fire at the apartment

Four people died.

It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire. See, that's important.

the institution before you left?

All I know is it's
a mental hospital.

38

For the criminally insane.

- Yep.

43

The other side of the island
is rock bluffs

all the way down
to the edge of the water.

45

The dock, it's the
only way on or off.

We'll be casting off

I'd appreciate it if
you'd hurry up about it.

- Storm's coming.

Welcome to Shutter Island.

52
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:54,253
I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

53
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,435
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

54
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,896
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

55
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,192
Electrified perimeter.

56
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,779
How can you tell?

57
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,699
I've seen something
like it before.

58
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:37,148
All right. You gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give,

59
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,192
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

60
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,652
Is that understood?

61
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,112
Absolutely.

62
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,908
The red brick building on your right
is Ward A, the male ward.

63
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:50,369
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

64
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:53,414
Ward C is that building
on the bluffs.

65
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,082
An old Civil War fort.

66
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,585
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

67
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,587
Admittance to Ward
C is forbidden

68
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,340
without the written consent
and physical presence

69
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,967
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

70
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,844
Is that understood?

71
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,222
You act like insanity is catching.

72
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,354
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

73
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,233
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

74
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,819
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

75
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,906
Executive order 319
of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries

76
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,033
states that when
inside a penitentiary,

77
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,536
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

78
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:39,418
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

79
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:02,149
Okay. Now that the official stuff's done,
come on, boys,

80
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,193
what do you say we go find
Dr. Cawley?

81
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,916
When did she escape?
This prisoner?

82
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,170
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have
to fill you in on the situation. Protocol.

want to consult a psychiatrist about?

They were beaten,

as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

115

We drove screws
into their brains,

we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness

- And now?
- We treat them.

Try to heal, try to cure.

120
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,532
And if that fails,
at least we provide them

121
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:47,815
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

I mean, they've hurt people.

- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases, yes.

- Is she considered dangerous?

132
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:26,061
You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.

She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

134

She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

135
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,197
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

136
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,617
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

He died on the beaches of Normandy.
She's a war widow.

She starved herself

- Sometimes. But today,

00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,135
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

156
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:43,597
and she gives us all
parts to play in that fiction.

157
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,600
So have you searched
the grounds yet?

158
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:49,270
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

159
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,854
Not a trace.

160
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,985
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

161
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:59,863
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

162
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,161
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

163
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,879
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

164
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,966
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

165
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:29,977
Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

166
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,980
I mean,
she's in a mental institution, right?

167
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,103
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

168
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,318
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

169
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,777
Two pairs.

170
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:43,115
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

171
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,077
So, she left here barefoot?

172
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:50,497

00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,173
it was murder.

609
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,596
Yeah, I've had
enough of killing.

610
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:45,100
That's not why I'm here.

611
00:44:46,143 --> 00:44:48,979
- So what is this all about?
- <font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font>

612
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:56,111
After Laeddis vanished, I started doing
some checking on Ashecliffe.

613
00:44:57,613 --> 00:45:00,699
A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

614
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,284
You know, it's like it...

615
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:04,828
it's like they're
scared or something.

616
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,875
You know, this place is funded
by a special grant

617
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,629
from The House
Un-American Activities Committee?

618
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:16,882
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting the communists

619
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:19,301
from an island in Boston Harbor?

620
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:22,554
By conducting experiments
on the mind.

621
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,432
At least that's my guess.

622
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,226
And you think that's
going on here?

623
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,811
Like I said, no one
would talk, right?

624
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:32,564
Till I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

625
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:37,027
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

626
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,154
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

627
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:40,614
Guess what they were testing?

628
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:41,782
Toothpaste.

629
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:44,243
So, he starts
seeing dragons everywhere.

630
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:49,331
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

631
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:53,460
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

632
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:58,465
Two weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs three men to death.

633
00:45:59,258 --> 00:46:03,971
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he...

634
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:08,517
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

635
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,728
Judge gives him life
in Dedham Prison.

636
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:15,565
- And you found him.
- Yeah, I found him.

637
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:18,151
Well, he's a mess.

638
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:21,863
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

639
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:23,073
What?

640
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,200
They're experimenting
on people here.

641
00:46:25,993 --> 00:46:27,703
I don't know, boss.

642
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:32,249
- How do you believe a crazy guy?
- That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

643
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:36,586
Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

644
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,839
I stood at Dachau.

645
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:43,760
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

646
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:46,430
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

647
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:51,393
and now... Now I find out it may be
happening here? On our soil? No.

648
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:55,188
So what are you really
here to do, Ted?

649
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:59,693
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

650
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:02,029
and I'm gonna blow the
lid off this place.

651
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:04,072
That's it.

652
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:06,366
Wait a minute.

653
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,745
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

654
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,308
waiting for a chance
to get out here,

655
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,915
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

656
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:17,878
Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient
escape. It was the perfect excuse.

657
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,964
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

658
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:22,716
The world doesn't work that way.

659
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:26,094
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

660
00:47:26,178 --> 00:47:29,306
Ward C is inside a
Civil War fort?

661
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:33,060
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

662
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:37,731
I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

663
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,816
- What if they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.

664
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,027
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

665
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,612
Bullshit. We came here
for Rachel Solando.

666
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,573
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

667
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:47,824
There's no way they
could've known

668
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:49,284
I'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

669
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:52,704
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

670
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:55,999
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

671
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:57,876
Now they have us both.
Here! Now!

672

675
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,722
How about that?
They found us, huh?

676
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:13,308
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

682
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:54,099
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

683
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:56,977
That is, if we all
don't wash away first.

684
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,523
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

685
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:03,275
So...

686
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,070
This is our only choice, huh?

687
00:49:07,154 --> 00:49:10,198
Got something really nice in
a prison gray if that don't work for you.

688
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:13,201
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

689
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:16,997
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all Ward C patients

690
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,332
be placed in manual restraints.

691
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:22,752
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

692
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,463
<font color="#808080">NAEHRING:</font> That would take
a lot of flooding.

695
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:29,968
A lot of flooding seems
like a distinct possibility.

696

<font color="#808080">DOCTOR 1:</font> It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

697

There's a backup generator.

698
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:36,516
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

699
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,312
Where are they going to go? Mmm?

700
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:43,398
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

701
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:44,483
<font color="#808080">NAEHRING:</font>
Oh, you're quite right.

702
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:47,736
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

703
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,573
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

704
00:49:51,907 --> 00:49:53,783
This is 24 human beings.

705
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:55,849
And you can live
with that, can you?

706
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:59,915
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B

707
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:01,333
in manual restraints as well.

709
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,922
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one quick question.

710
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,215
Yes, I'll be with
you in a moment.

711
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:11,301
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note...

712
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,094
"The law of four." I love that.

713
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:16,723
...you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

714
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:22,145
"Who is 67?" Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

715
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:24,898
Uh-huh. Nothing comes to mind?

716
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:28,818
Nothing?

717
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:37,827
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C

718
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:40,372
and 42 patients
in Wards A and B,

719
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:43,917
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

720
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:46,586
That is correct, yes.

721
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,467
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting

722
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:56,346
that you have a 67th
patient, Doctor.

723
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,349
But I'm afraid we don't.

00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:14,990

Why are they in my house?

734
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:45,979
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

735
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:50,692
Ma'am.

736
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:58,658
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

737
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:00,660
passing out literature.

738
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:03,663
Here?

739
00:52:05,874 --> 00:52:07,500
In this neighborhood?

740
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:09,336
Yes, I'm afraid so.

741
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:14,299
Now if you could tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

742
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,509
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

743
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:19,387
Yes, um...

00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,475
Well, I, um...

745
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,230
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

746
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:32,317
and then I

747

packed Jim's lunch and he left.

748
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:42,744
Then I sent the
children off to school.

749
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,416
And then

750

<font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font>

01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,345
<font color="#808080">TEDDY:</font>
There it is.

1050
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:07,184
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

1051
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:09,477
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

1052
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:11,229
There could be a way
behind those trees.

1053
01:18:11,313 --> 01:18:14,399
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

1054
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:15,525
- Boss...
- Come on.

1055
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:17,986
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

1056
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,863
It's proof there's
a 67th patient,

1057
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:22,782
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

1058
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:26,453
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

1059
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,498
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

1060
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:32,876
Why would you want to, Chuck?
Why?

1061
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,794
Because climbing down there
when it's dark

1062
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:38,048
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

1063
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:41,551
Okay, maybe you better
sit this one out then.

1064
01:18:43,136 --> 01:18:45,138
You brought me into this, boss,

1065
01:18:45,222 --> 01:18:48,558
and now we're trapped here on this rock,
on this island,

1066
01:18:48,642 --> 01:18:50,185
with no one to rely
on but each other,

1067
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:53,730
- and now you're acting like...
- Like what? Like what?

1068
01:18:54,356 --> 01:18:55,857
How am I acting?

1069
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:03,615
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

1070
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:11,081
What do you think the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck?

1071
01:19:11,665 --> 01:19:13,333
I'm from Seattle.

1072
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:17,212
Seattle.

1073
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:21,675
I'm going on

1074
01:19:22,509 --> 01:19:23,718
alone.

1075
01:19:26,096 --> 01:19:28,974
- I'm going with you, boss.
- I said alone.

1076
01:19:30,684 --> 01:19:31,810
Fine.

1077
01:19:58,461 --> 01:19:59,713
Damn it!

1078
01:20:00,714 --> 01:20:02,007
Damn it.

1079
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,098
I knew it wouldn't take long,
but I couldn't get to it.

1080
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:11,725
The tide was up.

1081
01:20:19,983 --> 01:20:21,109
Chuck!

1082
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:24,821
Chuck!

1083
01:21:26,383 --> 01:21:27,634
Come on!

1084

<font color="#D900D9">(EXCLAIMS)</font>

1085
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:04,170
Chuck!

1086
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:06,673
Where are you, Chuck?

1087
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:09,384

1088

1089
01:22:34,242 --> 01:22:35,410
Chuck!

1092
01:23:19,913 --> 01:23:21,289
Who are you?

1093
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:26,252
I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop.

1094
01:23:27,629 --> 01:23:29,339
You're the marshal.

1095
01:23:30,298 --> 01:23:31,966
That's right.

1096
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:38,014
Would you mind taking your hand
from behind your back, please?

1097
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:39,933
Why? Why?

1098
01:23:41,434 --> 01:23:44,437
I wanna make sure that
what you're holding won't hurt me.

1099
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,821
I'm gonna keep this

1100
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:56,824
if you don't mind.

1101
01:23:57,659 --> 01:23:59,077
Fine by me.

1102
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:09,462
You're...

1103
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,715
You're Rachel Solando.

1104
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,718
The real one.

1105
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:21,349
Did you kill your children?

1106
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:24,978
I never had children.

1107
01:24:25,645 --> 01:24:27,438
I was never married.

1108
01:24:28,982 --> 01:24:32,527
And before I was a patient at Ashecliffe,
I worked here.

1109
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,738
You... You were a nurse?

1110
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:40,034
I was a doctor, Marshal.

1111
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:45,164
You think I'm crazy.

1112
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,876
- No. No, no, I never...
- And if I say I'm not crazy?

1113
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:52,505
Well, that hardly
helps, does it?

1114
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:55,842
That's the Kafkaesque
genius of it.

1115
01:24:59,137 --> 01:25:01,431
People tell the
world you're crazy,

1116
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:05,435
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

1117
01:25:06,019 --> 01:25:09,188
I'm not following you.
I'm sorry.

1118
01:25:09,814 --> 01:25:11,774
Once you're declared insane,

1119
01:25:11,858 --> 01:25:15,361
then anything you do is called
part of that insanity.

1120
01:25:15,445 --> 01:25:21,034
Reasonable protests are denial.
Valid fears, paranoia.

1121
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:22,702
Survival instincts are

1122
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:25,163
defense mechanisms.

1123
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:29,208
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1124
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:32,754
- Tell me something.
- Yeah.

1125
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:35,715
What happened to you?

1126
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:39,969
I started asking about these
large shipments of sodium amytal

1127
01:25:40,053 --> 01:25:41,804
and opium-based hallucinogens.

1128
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:43,598
Psychotropic drugs.

1129
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:47,352
I asked about the
surgeries, too.

1130
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,564
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1131
01:25:53,107 --> 01:25:55,818
They zap the patient
with electroshock,

1132
01:25:55,902 --> 01:25:58,738
then go through the
eye with an ice pick,

1133
01:26:00,907 --> 01:26:02,992
pull out some nerve fibers.

1134
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:07,872
Makes the patients
much more obedient.

1135
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:09,290
Tractable.

1136
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,251
It's barbaric,

1137
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:14,754
unconscionable.

1138
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:19,509
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1139
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,220
Depends on where you're hurt?

1140
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:24,847
No, it has nothing to
do with the flesh.

1141
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:27,266
The brain controls pain.

1142
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:32,480
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

1143
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:36,609
What if you could control it?

1144
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:40,113
- You mean the brain?
- Recreate a man

1145
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:45,368
so he doesn't feel pain or love
or sympathy.

1146
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:48,371
A man who can't be interrogated,

1147
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:51,165
because he has no memories
to confess.

1148
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:57,422
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

1149
01:26:57,505 --> 01:27:01,634
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1150
01:27:01,718 --> 01:27:03,386
during their brainwashing
experiments.

1151
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:06,889
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1152
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:09,058
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world

1153
01:27:09,142 --> 01:27:12,395
and do things sane men...
Sane men never would.

1154
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:15,815
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1155
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:18,568
- that would take years.
- Years. Years of research.

1156
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:21,362
Hundreds of patients
to experiment on.

1157
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:26,576
Fifty years from now, people will
look back and say, here, this place,

1158
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:29,120
is where it all began.

1159
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:34,000
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags, and we,

1160
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:38,296
we tested patients
on Shutter Island.

1161
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:41,632
No, they won't.

1162
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,593
No.

1163
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:48,181
You do understand

1164
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:53,019
that they can't let you leave.

1165
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:56,647
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1166
01:27:58,024 --> 01:28:03,112
I was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

1167
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:06,824
Didn't matter.

1168
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:13,581
Let me ask you.
Any past traumas in your life?

1169
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:16,209
Yes.

1170
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:19,462
But why would that matter?

1171
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:21,839
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past

1172
01:28:21,923 --> 01:28:24,425
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1173
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:29,889
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1174
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,891
"Of course he cracked."

1175
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:34,143
"Who wouldn't
after what he'd been through?"

1176
01:28:34,227 --> 01:28:36,729
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1177
01:28:36,813 --> 01:28:39,774
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

1178
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:46,823
- How's your head?
- My head?

1179
01:28:46,906 --> 01:28:50,326
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1180
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:56,874
- Headaches?
- I am prone to migraines, yes.

1181
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:58,251
Jesus.

1182
01:29:00,545 --> 01:29:04,048
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
I mean, even aspirin?

1183
01:29:04,131 --> 01:29:06,300
- The aspirin?
- Jesus.

1184
01:29:06,968 --> 01:29:10,680
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

1185
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:14,141
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

1186
01:29:15,935 --> 01:29:17,144
No.

1187
01:29:18,104 --> 01:29:19,230
No.

1188
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:21,691
No, I haven't.

1189
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:24,527
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1190
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:27,196
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1191
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:30,825
Palsy comes first,

1192
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:35,204
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1193
01:29:36,122 --> 01:29:40,293
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, Marshal? Huh?

1194
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:45,756
Tell me what goes on
in that lighthouse.

1195
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:47,967
Tell me.

1196
01:29:49,135 --> 01:29:50,761
Brain surgery.

1197
01:29:51,429 --> 01:29:55,892
The let's-open-the-skull-and-see-
what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

1198
01:29:56,434 --> 01:29:59,312
The learned-it-from-the-Nazis
kind.

1199
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:03,858
That's where they
create the ghosts.

1200
01:30:05,276 --> 01:30:09,155
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

1201
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,742
Everyone.

1202
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:16,537
Come on. The nurses?
The orderlies?

1203

I won't be here. I move during the day.
New places every night.

But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

Haven't you heard
a word I've said?

1212

The only way off the island is the ferry,
and they control it.

Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1227

- What?
- God's gift.

1228

The violence.

1229
01:32:50,316 --> 01:32:54,695
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1230
01:32:54,779 --> 01:32:58,616
it reached out for me
like a divine hand.

1231

God loves violence.

1234
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:13,214
It's in us.

1235
01:33:13,756 --> 01:33:15,091
It's what we are.

1236
01:33:16,509 --> 01:33:18,844
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1237
01:33:18,928 --> 01:33:21,472
and pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh of our brothers.

1238
01:33:21,555 --> 01:33:25,476
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

1239
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:31,107
I thought God gave
us moral order.

1240
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:34,193
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1241
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:38,364
There's no moral order at all.
There's just this,

1242
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:41,158
can my violence conquer yours?

1243
01:33:46,539 --> 01:33:48,958
- I'm not violent.
- Yes, you are.

1244

You're as violent as they come.

I know this
because I'm as violent as they come.

If the constraints of
society were lifted,

1247

and I was all that stood
befween you and a meal,

Wouldn't you?

01:34:11,564 --> 01:34:14,024
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

- Oh, I know you.

We've known each
other for centuries.

If I was to sink my teeth
into your eye right now,

and you've uncovered
a conspiracy

- Of course I didn't!

Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1463
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:26,097
Because he called you Laeddis,

1464

and you'd do anything
not to be him.

you had with Noyce yesterday.

"This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

1467
01:51:38,943 --> 01:51:41,446
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

1468
01:51:41,529 --> 01:51:43,406
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1469
01:51:43,489 --> 01:51:46,868
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

1470
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:49,078
No, no, he meant that
it was my fault.

1471
01:51:49,162 --> 01:51:51,164
You almost killed him.

The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

- We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1501
01:53:53,745 --> 01:53:55,330
I swore before the
Board of Overseers

1502
01:53:55,413 --> 01:53:59,334
that I could construct the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play

we could get you to see how untrue,
how impossible it is.

here will be discredited. Everything.

1512

We're on the front lines of a war
here, old boy.

comes down to you.

02:08:42,549 --> 02:08:45,552
<font color="#D900D9">(WHISPERING)</font> Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

1654
02:08:51,308 --> 02:08:54,144
That's right.
We're too smart for them.

1655
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:57,397
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1656
02:09:13,038 --> 02:09:15,791
You know,
this place makes me wonder...

1657
02:09:16,333 --> 02:09:18,418
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1658
02:09:19,378 --> 02:09:21,338
Which would be worse,

1659
02:09:22,172 --> 02:09:23,840
to live as a monster

1660
02:09:24,758 --> 02:09:26,426
or to die as a good man?

1661
02:09:36,144 --> 02:09:37,437
Teddy?
